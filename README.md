## ℹ️ Project Info
A **Streamlit-based web app** that predicts the risk of multiple diseases using trained Machine Learning models.  
Currently supports prediction for **Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Liver Disease**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** (Frontend/UI)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Numpy & Pandas** (Data Processing)  
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive and user-friendly web app  
- Sidebar navigation for multiple diseases  
- Risk percentage prediction with clear visualization  
- Option to download prediction reports  
- Mobile and desktop responsive  

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **Diabetes**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- **Heart Disease**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Parkinson's**: UCI Parkinson’s Dataset  
- **Liver Disease**: Indian Liver Patient Dataset

## 📝 How It Works
1. User enters medical details through the web interface.  
2. Input data is preprocessed and scaled where required.  
3. The trained ML model predicts disease risk.  
4. Results are displayed with **risk percentage** and interpretation.  
5. Optionally, users can download a report of the prediction.
